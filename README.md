# Semiconductor Wafer Defect Detection using Edge AI

This repository contains Phase-1 work of an Edge-AI based semiconductor wafer defect detection system developed for the IESA DeepTech Hackathon.

Phase-1 focuses on CNN model development, evaluation, and ONNX export.  
Phase-2 will cover embedded edge deployment.
